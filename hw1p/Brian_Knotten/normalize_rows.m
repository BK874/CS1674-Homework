% 8. Write a function function [B] = normalize_rows(A) which uses a
% single command (one line and no loops) to make the sum in each
% row of the matrix 1. You may need to use repmat, depending on
% your Matlab version. Note that the sum of the entries in each row
% should be 1, in the matrix output by your function.

function [B] = normalize_rows(A)

B = A./sum(A,2);
